The objective of this little project (projectlet?) is to figure out under what conditions a game of war is infinite (=enters a cycle.)

We define the order in which we put the cards back into the deck to be WINNING CARD ON TOP OF LOSING CARD. In case of tie, the order in which cards are added to the back of the deck are: W_N L_N W_N-1 L_N-1 ...W1 L1 (top to bottom).
